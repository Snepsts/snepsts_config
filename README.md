# snepsts config

Welcome to my config files and stuff

This is mainly a repo to store my arch linux i3 configuration. Since just about everything is stored in files I figured I could just upload them here. Having version history is nice, too.

The installing arch guide will help make all of the files here actually useful. I intend on having specific versions for my laptop and for my desktop at the very least.

Finally, I also wanted to keep track of some of the things that I can't exactly remember but know what I need to do, like github gpg/ssh and looking at fonts.

Thanks for reading
